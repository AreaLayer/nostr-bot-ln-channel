### How works 

- Nostr Protocol: The bot connects to Nostr relays to listen for specific events/messages. When it detects a relevant message (e.g., a request for LN channel recommendations), it processes this request.
- Lightning Network: The bot interacts with an LN node (like LND) to gather data about channels. It applies some logic to recommend channels based on certain criteria (e.g., channel capacity, reliability).
- Integration: The bot then sends the recommendations back through the Nostr network to the user who requested them.

### Securtiy considerations

- Run your Lightning Node stable and secure
- Use a secure and reliable Nostr relay
- Choose Relays stable
- Self-custody keys (Nostr and Lightning Node)
- Currently Lightning Node supported: LND, Core Lightning (CLN)
